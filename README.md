# color
A single depedency for a few applications I've had to maintain. I've been unable to find the source of [color.min.js](color.min.js) anywhere on the net, so here it is.

Having this file on GitHub gives me the option of using [napa](https://github.com/shama/napa) via npm to install it as a dependency.
